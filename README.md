 Java Enterprise Backend Application with Spring MVC

This project is a robust backend application built using Java and the Spring MVC framework, designed to support a modern enterprise system with a separate React frontend. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and adheres to clean architectural principles, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and ease of integration.

The backend exposes RESTful APIs consumed by the frontend, handles business logic, manages persistent data, and enforces security and validation rules.

Core Components:

Spring MVC: Manages request routing, data binding, and controller logic.

Spring Boot: Simplifies configuration and bootstrapping of the application.

Spring Data JPA: Provides an abstraction layer for database access, enabling seamless interaction with a MySQL database.

RESTful API: The backend exposes endpoints for CRUD operations and other services, consumed by a React frontend.



Validation and Exception Handling: Uses Springâ€™s validation framework and centralized exception management to ensure robust API behavior.

Tools & Technologies:
